# Subconscious Systems

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, run the Convex dev server:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

If you've never run the Convex dev server before, you'll need to set up a convex account and sign in.
In order for it to run properly, you'll need to add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your convex environment variables.

Now your app should be running!
